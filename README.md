# React Boilerplate

A sensible, minimal, and server-agnostic boilerplate for React projects.

## Features

* Simple build and file watching
* Cache-busted resources
* Latest ES6/7 features
* JavaScript linting with ESLint
* Support for Sass and auto-prefixed styles
* Server-agnostic (Express? Python? PHP? no problem)
* Fully valid and semantic HTML

## Getting Started

After cloning the boilerplate for the first time, run `cp public/env.local.json public/env.json` to copy a default environment file. Then, start the development server:

```
npm run dev-server
```
